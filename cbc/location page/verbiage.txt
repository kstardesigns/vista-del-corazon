Just 25 minutes from the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport in Mesa and 35 minutes from Sky Harbor airport in Phoenix, Vista del Corazon is located in  beautiful Gold Canyon in the foothills of the Superstition Mountains.

Vista de Corazon overlooks the green fairways of the award winning Dinosaur Mountain golf course of the Gold Canyon Golf Resort.

With an average elevation of 2000 ft, Vista del Corazon offers valley views, city light views, Superstition Mountain views and distant views of the San Tan Mountains.  The hills offer a slightly cooler temperature of about 5 degrees and breezes not found further downhill. 

Often the deer, the rabbits and the quail can be seen side by side harvesting the freshly manicured fairway grass out on the course.
